[https://github.com/web3privacy/hackathon-2025-berlin/hacker-manual.md](https://github.com/web3privacy/hackathon-2025-berlin/hacker-manual.md)

Website: [https://hackathon.web3privacy.info](https://hackathon.web3privacy.info)


Submission Deadline: 16:30, Sunday 15th of June.

## HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR PROJECTS

We will not use any integrated platform for hacker submissions (DevFolio, etc)

At the start of the hackathon the W3PN team will create a new Github repository

Within that repository will be a template for submissions

Hackers must copy that template and create a .md for their project using that templalte

The hackathon team will be create placeholder folders for teams/projects within the shared repository after hackathon begins

PRs will open to the for any hacker to PR in any of the following:
 – a README.md for their project (a template will be provided in the repo)
 – any code that can be tested / links to their repository (does not have to be hosted on Github)
 – any presentations/slides relating to the project (.odp / .odg / .otp format ideally)

PRs will be merged into this submissions repository once submissions close.

If no hackers within the project has access to a Github account, the W3PN can act as proxy for the uploading of their project submission to the repository.
