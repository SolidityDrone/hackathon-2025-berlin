## **TECH AGNOSTIC BUILDING**: Empowering open innovation

Build for Impact, Not Just Bounties

While most hackathons prioritize short-term wins, we’re here to foster real-world, self-sustaining privacy solutions. Projects are judged not just on technical merit, but also on business logic, real-world use cases, and long-term impact—ensuring your work lives on well beyond the event.

Our tracks are tech-, chain-, and protocol-agnostic. No forced stacks. No vendor agendas. You’re free to choose the best tools for your vision, without being boxed in by bounty-driven constraints.


## Collaboration over competition: 
Collaborate with designers, engineers, marketers, and researchers, while gaining direct access to independent industry mentors. Work on meaningful open-source tools and create lasting, impactful solutions.


## **ADVICE, TIPS and INSPIRATION** 
Explore our [Privacy Builder Pack](build.web3privacy.info) to find: 
* A curated collection of tools and resources
* Insights from seasoned hackers
* An Idea Generator to spark your creativity

---

### 1) **Advanced Cryptography**
Cryptography is the backbone of digital security and privacy, powering everything we do. As an academic field it is constantly evolving and advances in this field can be difficult to understand or implement.

This track evolves around utilising advanced cryptographic tools within new use cases:

    - MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
    - TEE (Trusted Execution Environments)
    - ZK (Zero Knowledge proofs)
    - DID (Decentralised Identity protocols)
    - FHE (Fully homomorphic encryption)

### 2) **Applied Encryption** 
How can we practically strengthen the cryptography behind the tools and services people rely on today? 

Enhance existing projects, revive abandoned ones, and apply new logic to proven encryption models.

Examples:

    - Encrypt hidden messages within music (carnation.fm)
    - Investigating and flagging privacy technologies using outdated cryptographic libraries
    - Rejuvenating sunset projects with outdated cryptography
    - Create a privacy/encryption-focused CRM system
    - Add Threshold or Multi-signature schemes in single-sig wallets
    - Improving encryption standards for Post-Quantum Resistance
    - Adding double-ratchet or modern encryption protocols to applications
    - plausible deniability: designated-verifier proofs in verifiable credentials

### 3) **Censorship Resistance**
Build or empower protocols and networks that protect users and content against digital censorship by outside parties.

Supported Networks:

        - Tor Browser
        - i2p
        - mixnets (0KN, HOPR, Katzenpost, Nym, xx.network)
        - Nostr
        - Fileverse
Example Technology Stacks:

        - BitTorrent
        - Mesh networks (Reticulum / Meshtastic)
        - Bluetooth mesh networks
        - Adding privacy to current p2p protocols

### 4) **Privacy-first AI**
As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is important that we can interact with it in the best possible way. User's right to privacy should be respected from all perspectives and by default.

Focus Areas:

    - Protect personal files while giving AI access to your codebase
    - Utilise AI systems on sensitive information securely
    - Censorship-resistant LLMs / AI models
    - Build applications that utilise anonymous datasets
    - Disrupt AI facial recognition systems

### 5) **Public Goods**
How can we protect individual privacy while enabling real-world impact and public infrastructure? This track invites builders to create privacy-preserving solutions that enhance compliance, aid, and coordination—especially where traditional systems fail.


Focus Areas:
- Privacy-first aid & payments // Tools for funding, verified recipients, merchants, and nonprofits—without exposing personal data or requiring government IDs.
- Identity for the underserved // Privacy-preserving identity and civic tools for off-grid, stateless, or emerging communities.
- Privacy-preserving tools for public goods funding and governance // Privacy-focused platforms for grants, voting, and coordination—supporting collective action while protecting individual rights.

### 6) **Design (UI/UX)**
We frequently hear that privacy enhancing apps and platforms have "bad UI/UX" and that they are not welcoming to new users in a friendly way. 

This track seeks to encourage designers, marketers, and developers to improve application general look-n-feel.

- Speed up your building process or prototype quickly by re-using Figma files of real products. Find similar projects and copy-paste design elements from [this library](https://www.deepwork.network/case-studies). 

- Explore the many ready to copy and paste designs for your app http://lottecss.com (no need to apply classes, use with your semantic html/jsx markup, minimal (familiar) utility classes so you don't need tailwind)

    - ethereum.org/developers/docs/design-and-ux
    - dexola.com/blog/designing-user-centric-dapps-5-best-practices-for-web3-ux

### 7) **User Onboarding**
Privacy-focused applications often suffer from proper onboarding process for new users. This track seeks to enhance the new user experience.
    
    Examples:
    * Improving in-app onboarding process
    * Improving app and website accessibility (WC3 standards)
    * Curation of "2025 cryptographic best practices" for web3 wallet devs
    * Review of the current e2e landscape in chat and social media
    * Creating video guides for protocols

## **MENTORS** 
To help you build meaningful, user-centered solutions with real impact, we’ve brought in trusted, independent mentors—each with deep, hands-on expertise across diverse fields. At W3PN HACKS we embrace a holistic approach, offering support from technical execution and idea validation to socio-cultural insight. Let’s build tools that truly matter—now.

## **HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR PROJECTS** (github) 

- We will not use any integrated platform for hacker submissions (DevFolio, etc)
- At the start of the hackathon the W3PN team will create a new Github repository
- Within that repository will be a template for submissions
- Hackers must copy that template and create a .md for their project using that templalte
- The hackathon team will be create placeholder folders for teams/projects within the shared repository after hackathon begins
- PRs will open to the for any hacker to PR in any of the following:
-- a README.md for their project (a template will be provided in the repo)
-- any code that can be tested / links to their repository (does not have to be hosted on Github)
-- any presentations/slides relating to the project (.odp / .odg / .otp format ideally)

- PRs will be merged into this submissions repository once submissions close.
- If no hackers within the project has access to a Github account, the W3PN can act as proxy for the uploading of their project submission to the repository.

# **JUDGING CRITERIA**
Judging Criteria
1 - Technology
2 - Real-Use Cases
3 - Privacy Improvement

2 - Was the submission aligned with modern web/coding practices?
3 - Could you see developers within the ecosystems of the technologies used being excited by the submission?
4 - Would you run this code?
5 - Would you integrate this code into one of your projects?
6 - Would you be interested in forking and improving this code (intention)
7 - Does is compile? Have you managed to test-run it?
8 - Are there real technological or physical constraints of the submission ("it would boil all the world's oceans")

## Real-Use Cases
1 - Could you see yourself running this code if full developed after the hackathon?
2 - Could you see normies using the submission?
3 - Could you see this positively impacting the lives of everyday users?
4 - Could you see this positively impacting the lives of people/communities at risk?
5 - Does this have a real world use case or is it only an intersting idea?

## Privacy Improvement

2 - Does it massive improve privacy?
3 - Can you see ways it could further improve the privacy?
4 - Does the submission consider web2 and web1 privacy leaking in the submission? 
5 - Would you use this submission if your life dependend on it working privately?

## Business-logic
1 - Would a VC back this?
2 - Is this already in the market?
3 - Could you see privacy respecting revenue creation from this submission?
4 - Did the person consider or present ideas about financial sustainability?
5 - Would you think this submission could make it market and be used by users in an AppStore ecosystem?
 
## Vibe
This track is a wildcard 20 points judges can attribute as they see fit, not a judgement on the drip or flex of the person submitting, and definately not a vibe-check. Keeping it fun and giving the judge a 'open vote' where they can give anywhere from 0 or 20 points

"Our judges will prioritise technical solutions and reward hackers not just about a working Proof of Concept application or good business logic in their pitch. Judges will assess the impact of what the team or person has done during the course of the hackathon."
